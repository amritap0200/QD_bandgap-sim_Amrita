# Quantum Dot Bandgap Calculator
A simple Python tool that calculates how the color of light emitted by quantum dots changes with their size.

# How It Works
The calculator uses this simple science rule:
Bandgap Energy (eV) = 1.8 / (dot size in nm)^2

This calculator helps in:
- Predicting what color light a quantum dot will emit
- Understanding how smaller dots emit bluer light
